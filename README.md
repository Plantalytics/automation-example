# automation-example
Just an example repo for test automation and Travis CI

Application.py contains the methods I made up for this demostration.

The folder 'tests' contains the unit tests for those methods.

.travis.yml contains the Travis configuration.

To run the unit tests use the following command:
python -m discover tests

The application itself doesn't really do anything, so don't worry about running it directly.
